# Overview

I think next generation of RMC should be an eco system built on top of NXL File Format. Compare with other similiar products, the NXL File Format allows RMC to provide user both file sharing and file management (RM/DLP/Tracking).

# Protect

File will be protected in NXL format.

# Share

File can be shared without worrying about data leaking. And user can always track file's usage, or revoke the sharing.

# On-the-fly decryption

This is important because finally user need to use protected/shared files.
So RMC need to be able to allow user to view and edit NXL files using their original apps.
