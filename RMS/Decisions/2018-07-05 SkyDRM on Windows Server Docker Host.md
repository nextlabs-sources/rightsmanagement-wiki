> I agree with the approach and that we should let Rehau know that our product currently only support Linux host.   
> 
> However, I do believe that we will not be able to ignore Windows Server host, I think it is just a matter of time, we will need to support Windows container on Windows Server host. Thus, I am willing to tell Rehau that we have the Windows container on Windows Server host support is on the 2019 roadmap (Q2 2019).
