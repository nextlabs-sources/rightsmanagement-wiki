Keng,

As discussed f2f with you this afternoon you recommended that we continue to build with HOOPS and release with the current license we have from  TechSoft3D. 
Please confirm, and we will proceed until further advice. 

Thanks
-Sriram

Lakshmi,

We have a meeting with Keng this morning. And he suggested that we proceed with already downloaded SDK. For the support license, account/IT will continue/help later. But for our product release, we can move the same time, as we are close to RC.

Thanks,
Raymond

Hi Allen, sorry I have no clue about HOOPS SDK from Tech Soft 3D. Let’s ask accounting if they can retrieve the receipt, then we can contact to obtain login or license key.

hi Accounting, can you help retrieve the receipt?

Best Regards,
-David

Hi David,

I think NextLabs has purchased some kind of license for HOOPS SDK from a company called Tech Soft 3D.  Do you know anything about it?  If yes, can you tell us the details of the license?  The CDC team is using it to develop the next RMC Windows app.

Thank you.
