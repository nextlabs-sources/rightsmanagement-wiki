# Caching Choices #

This lists some of the options under consideration for the cached data store to replace embedded infinispan in the on-prem+saas offering of skydrm (because current solution has issues tied to jgroups).

One way to proceed would be to narrow down the dimensions and then investigate fewer options further. This is because use case of the cache store is limited (it stores much less data than db which is already a single point and not "sharded") as compared to full data grid solutions.

Infinispan server mode has been tested as a swarm service with minimal code change.
