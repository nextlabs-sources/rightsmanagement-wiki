Features & behaviour for the enterprise SkyDRM offer.  

* SkyDRM can be used to manage tokens for a large number of file servers in the enterprise. These could translate into multiple projects. Logging in to the webapp will show a lot of empty projects. What should the admin / user see?
* How should project memberships be managed for the enterprise offer? The way we create & manage project members does not scale well for enterprise use cases.
* Offline batch encryption using smart classifier -> you have a hierarchy of NXL encrypted files. Can we provide a feature that allows this hierarchy to be made visible as a project in SkyDRM? It will be faster than uploading each file into SkyDRM.
