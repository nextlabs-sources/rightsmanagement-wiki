# RMS: Use "Save As" instead of "Download"
  
Decision date: 2018-12-11     
Approval: Approved   
Approver: Keng   
  
  
It was agreed to replace the words "Download" in the UX with "Save As". The reasoning is in the mail from Keng below.

>  I support Michelle's recommendation of using "SaveAs" to replace download in UI, but the meaning of rights for Download and SaveAs are the same. At this point, I don't think we need to support resetting rights when SaveAs.

>  If we can get the support for SaveAs into RMD and RMX for Office both in Dec, I would like to get both in. If not, it will be good to get it in RMD on the Dec release and get the RMX support in Jan.

For now, we agreed that there will be no change in the actual RIGHT saved in the NXL header. There will be no change in the policy or interpretation either. There will be no change in the Webapp UX to download files. The only changes will be on the screens where the policy is created, or where files are uploaded with ad-hoc rights.
