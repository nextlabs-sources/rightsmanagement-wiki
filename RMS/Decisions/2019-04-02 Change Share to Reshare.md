Decision date: 2019-04-02       
Approval: Approved   
Approver: Keng   
  
  
It was agreed to replace the words "Share" in the UX with "Reshare". This applies to ad-hoc files as well as central policy files.  
  
Note:   
  
This impacts issues related to the UX, e.g., [54124](http://bugs.cn.nextlabs.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54124)
