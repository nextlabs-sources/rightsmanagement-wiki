## Feedback

### -- Xifeng

Questions:
	
	1. Can the administrator login as normal user? -- need clarify from Keng
	2. Should we have same idps as normal login? -- Yes we should
	3. Shall we have different login UI?



Issues need to be solved:

	1. We need to define scope for different admin roles.
	2. We may need to support creating tenant in super admin console.
	3. Central policy definition is required.
