## Build 157 Deployment Instructions
  
####	Setup log4j
-	The basic steps is documented [here](https://bitbucket.org/nxtlbs-devops/rightsmanagement-wiki/wiki/RMS/setup/Setup%20Log4j)  
-	Add this line in `setenv.sh`: 
``
export HOSTNAME="$HOSTNAME".  
``
This is because in AWS EC2 environment somehow log4j config file couldnâ€™t read system variables, it can only read catalina variables.   
And you need to make sure different instances have different hostnames. Now two testdrm viewer instances testdrm-viewer1 and testdrm-viewer2 have same hostname testdrm.com. 
-	Copy log4j2_rms.xml  log4j2_router.xml  log4j2_viewer.xml files to $RMS_SHARED_DIR/conf/ folder  
####	Setup infinispan  
-	Copy infinispan_clustered.xml  jgroups_aws.xml files to $RMS_SHARED_DIR/conf/ folder  
-	Change AWS_PING configuration in jgroups_aws.xml, either use EC2 instance profile or use IAM credentials to control the access.  
-	Make sure port 7800 is opened and proper IAM rules has been created.  
####	Change properties file  
-	Change web.inbuilt_service_provider to web.inbuilt_storage_provider in admin.properties 
-       Set web.inbuilt_storage_provider.attributes in admin.properties for example:
```
web.inbuilt_storage_provider.attributes={ \
        "APP_ID": "AKIAIG7EUVZEX27G6K5Q",       \
        "APP_SECRET": "fEckHWr3hLg62bOet/0IzDMJDJfn9EobRtXZRil0", \
        "MYSPACE_BUCKET_NAME": "rmtest-mydrive", \
        "PROJECT_BUCKET_NAME": "rmtest-mydrive" \
}
```
-	Add a new line: encrypt.secrets= in both admin.properties and router.properties
