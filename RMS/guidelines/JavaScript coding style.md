As mentioned in the Java coding convention page, our current convention for Java is to use spaces rather than tabs for indentation.  As a result of this, most RMS developers have already likely configured their IDEs to have the tab key add spaces rather than an actual tab.  Typically, many IDEs will use 4 spaces for one tab.

We should try to be consistent when working with JavaScript and most other files with regard to using spaces for indentation.  However, some of our old legacy UI files still use tabs for indentation.  It can be a nuisance when editing such files, because our IDEs are likely configured to use spaces instead of tabs.  In order to preserve the history of such legacy files, we may continue to use tabs.  However, moving forward we should use spaces for indentation even in our UI files for consistency.
